# 👋 Hi there

I'm a passionate crypto enthusiast with a deep interest in blockchain technology, decentralized networks, and the future of Web3. My primary focus is on running nodes and setting up validators across various blockchain ecosystems. I believe in the transformative power of decentralization and strive to contribute to the growth and security of blockchain networks.

## 🌐 What I Do
- **Node Operations:** I specialize in deploying and maintaining nodes for multiple blockchain protocols.
- **Validator Setup:** I configure and optimize validators to ensure they operate efficiently and securely.
- **Blockchain Research:** Constantly exploring new projects and innovations within the crypto space.
- **Community Engagement:** Actively participating in blockchain communities to share knowledge and stay updated on industry trends.

## 🚀 Skills
- **Node Management:** Proficient in setting up full nodes, archive nodes, and light nodes.
- **Validator Configuration:** Experienced in setting up and managing validator nodes, with a focus on security and uptime.
- **Scripting & Automation:** Automating node setups and validator processes using shell scripting and various tools.

## 🔗 Validators
Here are some of the validators I've set up and currently manage:
- **Mantra:** `mantravaloper14s9yvrq8v3r80tdjwgx65nw50sdw05ru3true4`
- **OJO:** `ojovaloper1kanazvczel8p55ad2jzkgxyr94eugal35vphza`
- **CrossFi:** `mxvaloper1yhw0vt5a4psaunglkvxlh03uczlvsn5gp64pqe`
